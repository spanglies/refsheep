### Incorrect Eyes/Sclera
Videah's eyes have **yellow sclera** (sclera is usually the white part of eyes) which some artists interpret as *yellow iris*. This is incorrect!
The iris should be drawn either all black or brown depending on which the artist thinks is suitable for their style.

{{ videah_eyes() }}

This is the most common mistake by far so please make sure you get this right! üò≠

### Missing Markings
Videah has stripe markings on different parts of his body that many artists tend to overlook.

The most common one that artists miss are the **stripes on his ears**.
Think of his ears as being little [VLC traffic cones.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VLC_media_player)
